##capimage


A python script that generates resizable image from original image with cap insets for iOS Dev.
The script assumes you use Apple's prescribed high-resolution modifier (@2x) to name your high-resolution image.
For example, if you want to generate a resizable image for 'my_image.png',the script will also check if high-resolution image exists.
